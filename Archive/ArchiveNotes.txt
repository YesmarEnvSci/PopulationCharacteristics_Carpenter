Archive Notes:

fishidexplore.R Created all kinds of histograms based on length, weight, location of capture, etc. Other than the location of capture I think it is mostly redundant in fishidlengthandweight.R.

fishidrecaps.R Had a recap summary but also had some very specific calculations to determine the percentage of recaps during a couple time periods. This was basically to determine if there was a high enough recapture percentage to justify a mark recapture study for Bull Trout.
